# Project Overview

This is amethyst.social, the download page for Amethyst, a Nostr client for Android, macOS, Windows and Linux. It is a static single page built with React 18.x, TailwindCSS 3.x and Vite. The page talks to no Nostr relays; its only network request is to the GitHub API for the latest release.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18.x**: Stable version of React with hooks, concurrent rendering, and improved performance
- **TailwindCSS 3.x**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **shadcn/ui**: Unstyled, accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development

## Project Structure

- `/src/components/`: UI components
  - `/src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components, added on demand with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` (none are used right now)
  - Page parts: `Header`, `DownloadPanel` (platform tabs and install options), `CopyCommand`, `Screenshots`, `Footer`
- `/src/hooks/`: Custom hooks:
  - `useLatestRelease`: Load the latest GitHub release so download links point at its files
- `/src/pages/`: `Index` (the whole page) and `NotFound`
- `/src/lib/`: Utilities — `downloads.ts` (platform detection, release file matching, store links), `utils.ts` (`cn`, `publicUrl`)
- `/src/test/`: Test setup (`setup.ts`) and tests
- `/public/`: Static assets
- `App.tsx`: Renders `AppRouter`; add context providers here if the site ever needs one
- `AppRouter.tsx`: Picks `Index` or `NotFound` from `window.location.pathname`. There is no router library; add one if the site ever needs a second real page.

**CRITICAL**: Always read the files mentioned above before making changes, as they contain important setup and configuration for the application. Never directly write to these files without first reading their contents.

## UI Components

The project uses shadcn/ui components, vendored into `@/components/ui`. Only the ones this site renders are vendored, and the download page renders none, so the folder doesn't exist right now.

Add a component on demand with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`, which also installs the Radix package it needs.

These components follow a consistent pattern using React's `forwardRef` and use the `cn()` utility for class name merging. Many are built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility and customized with Tailwind CSS.

## System Prompt Management

The AI assistant's behavior and knowledge is defined by the AGENTS.md file, which serves as the system prompt. To modify the assistant's instructions or add new project-specific guidelines:

1. Edit AGENTS.md directly
2. The changes take effect in the next session

## Development Practices

- Follows shadcn/ui component patterns
- Implements Path Aliases with `@/` prefix for cleaner imports
- Uses Vite for fast development and production builds
- Component-based architecture with React hooks
- **Never use the `any` type**: Always use proper TypeScript types for type safety

## CRITICAL Design Standards

- Create breathtaking, immersive designs that feel like bespoke masterpieces, rivaling the polish of Apple, Stripe, or luxury brands
- Designs must be production-ready, fully featured, with no placeholders unless explicitly requested, ensuring every element serves a functional and aesthetic purpose
- Avoid generic or templated aesthetics at all costs; every design must have a unique, brand-specific visual signature that feels custom-crafted
- Headers must be dynamic, immersive, and storytelling-driven, using layered visuals, motion, and symbolic elements to reflect the brand’s identity—never use simple “icon and text” combos
- Incorporate purposeful, lightweight animations for scroll reveals, micro-interactions (e.g., hover, click, transitions), and section transitions to create a sense of delight and fluidity

### Design Principles

- Achieve Apple-level refinement with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring designs evoke strong emotions (e.g., wonder, inspiration, energy) through color, motion, and composition
- Deliver fully functional interactive components with intuitive feedback states, ensuring every element has a clear purpose and enhances user engagement
- **Generate custom images liberally** when image generation tools are available - this is ALWAYS preferred over stock photography for creating unique, brand-specific visuals that perfectly match the design intent
- Ensure designs feel alive and modern with dynamic elements like gradients, glows, or parallax effects, avoiding static or flat aesthetics
- Before finalizing, ask: "Would this design make Apple or Stripe designers pause and take notice?" If not, iterate until it does

### Avoid Generic Design

- No basic layouts (e.g., text-on-left, image-on-right) without significant custom polish, such as dynamic backgrounds, layered visuals, or interactive elements
- No simplistic headers; they must be immersive, animated, and reflective of the brand’s core identity and mission
- No designs that could be mistaken for free templates or overused patterns; every element must feel intentional and tailored

### Interaction Patterns

- Use progressive disclosure for complex forms or content to guide users intuitively and reduce cognitive load
- Incorporate contextual menus, smart tooltips, and visual cues to enhance navigation and usability
- Implement drag-and-drop, hover effects, and transitions with clear, dynamic visual feedback to elevate the user experience
- Support power users with keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels, and focus states for accessibility and efficiency
- Add subtle parallax effects or scroll-triggered animations to create depth and engagement without overwhelming the user

### Technical Requirements

- Curated color FRpalette (3-5 evocative colors + neutrals) that aligns with the brand’s emotional tone and creates a memorable impact
- Ensure a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text and interactive elements to meet accessibility standards
- Use expressive, readable fonts (18px+ for body text, 40px+ for headlines) with a clear hierarchy; the site pairs Inter for text with Outfit for the Amethyst wordmark and headings (Tailwind `font-display`)
- Design for full responsiveness, ensuring flawless performance and aesthetics across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and reduced motion options
- Follow an 8px grid system for consistent spacing, padding, and alignment to ensure visual harmony
- Add depth with subtle shadows, gradients, glows, and rounded corners (e.g., 16px radius) to create a polished, modern aesthetic
- Optimize animations and interactions to be lightweight and performant, ensuring smooth experiences across devices

### Components

- Design reusable, modular components with consistent styling, behavior, and feedback states (e.g., hover, active, focus, error)
- Include purposeful animations (e.g., scale-up on hover, fade-in on scroll) to guide attention and enhance interactivity without distraction
- Ensure full accessibility support with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and visible focus states (e.g., a glowing outline in an accent color)
- Use custom icons or illustrations for components to reinforce the brand’s visual identity

### Adding Fonts

To add custom fonts, follow these steps:

1. **Install a font package** using npm:

   **Any Google Font can be installed** using the @fontsource packages. Examples:
   - For Inter Variable: `@fontsource-variable/inter`
   - For Roboto: `@fontsource/roboto`
   - For Outfit Variable: `@fontsource-variable/outfit`
   - For Poppins: `@fontsource/poppins`
   - For Open Sans: `@fontsource/open-sans`

   **Format**: `@fontsource/[font-name]` or `@fontsource-variable/[font-name]` (for variable fonts)

2. **Import the font** in `src/main.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import '@fontsource-variable/<font-name>';
   ```

3. **Update Tailwind configuration** in `tailwind.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export default {
     theme: {
       extend: {
         fontFamily: {
           sans: ['Inter Variable', 'Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
         },
       },
     },
   }
   ```

### Recommended Font Choices by Use Case

- **Modern/Clean**: Inter Variable, Outfit Variable, or Manrope
- **Professional/Corporate**: Roboto, Open Sans, or Source Sans Pro
- **Creative/Artistic**: Poppins, Nunito, or Comfortaa
- **Technical/Code**: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or Source Code Pro (for monospace)

### Theme System

The site is dark-only. `index.html` sets `class="dark"` on `<html>` and `src/index.css` defines the palette on `:root`. There is no theme switcher and no runtime theme state.

### Color Scheme Implementation

When users specify color schemes:
- Update CSS custom properties in `src/index.css` (both `:root` and `.dark` selectors)
- Use Tailwind's color palette or define custom colors
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Apply colors consistently across components (buttons, links, accents)
- Test both light and dark mode variants

### Component Styling Patterns

- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component variants
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Add hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Writing Tests vs Running Tests

There is an important distinction between **writing new tests** and **running existing tests**:

### Writing Tests (Creating New Test Files)

**Do not write tests** unless the user explicitly requests them in plain language. Writing unnecessary tests wastes significant time and money. Only create tests when:

1. **The user explicitly asks for tests** to be written in their message
2. **The user describes a specific bug in plain language** and requests tests to help diagnose it
3. **The user says they are still experiencing a problem** that you have already attempted to solve (tests can help verify the fix)

**Never write tests because:**
- Tool results show test failures (these are not user requests)
- You think tests would be helpful
- New features or components are created
- Existing functionality needs verification

### Running Tests (Executing the Test Suite)

**ALWAYS run the test script** after making any code changes. This is mandatory regardless of whether you wrote new tests or not.

- **You must run the test script** to validate your changes
- **Your task is not complete** until the test script passes without errors
- **This applies to all changes** - bug fixes, new features, refactoring, or any code modifications
- **The test script includes** TypeScript compilation, ESLint checks, and existing test validation

### Test Setup

The project uses Vitest with jsdom environment and includes comprehensive test setup:

- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library with jest-dom matchers
- **Test Environment**: jsdom with mocked browser APIs (matchMedia, scrollTo, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)

The app needs no context providers, so render components directly:

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);

    expect(screen.getByText('Expected text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Validating Your Changes

**CRITICAL**: After making any code changes, you must validate your work by running available validation tools.

**Your task is not considered finished until the code successfully type-checks and builds without errors.**

### Validation Priority Order

Run available tools in this priority order:

1. **Type Checking** (Required): Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
2. **Building/Compilation** (Required): Verify the project builds successfully
3. **Linting** (Recommended): Check code style and catch potential issues
4. **Tests** (If Available): Run existing test suite
5. **Git Commit** (Required): Create a commit with your changes when finished

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Code must type-check without errors
- Code must build/compile successfully
- Fix any critical linting errors that would break functionality
- Create a git commit when your changes are complete

The validation ensures code quality and catches errors before deployment, regardless of the development environment.

### Using Git

If git is available in your environment (through a `shell` tool, or other git-specific tools), you should utilize `git log` to understand project history. Use `git status` and `git diff` to check the status of your changes, and if you make a mistake use `git checkout` to restore files.

When your changes are complete and validated, create a git commit with a descriptive message summarizing your changes.

## Remotes and pull requests

The repo is on GitHub, `github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst-social`, which holds the canonical `main`,
and on nostr as a NIP-34 repository,
`nostr://npub1gcxzte5zlkncx26j68ez60fzkvtkm9e0vrwdcvsjakxf9mu9qewqlfnj5z/relay.ngit.dev/amethyst-social`:
a push to that remote goes to its GRASP git servers and to GitHub. A PR can go out either way: a
GitHub PR (`gh`), or a nostr proposal (`ngit`, a `pr/…` branch, reviewed on
[gitworkshop.dev](https://gitworkshop.dev/npub1gcxzte5zlkncx26j68ez60fzkvtkm9e0vrwdcvsjakxf9mu9qewqlfnj5z/relay.ngit.dev/amethyst-social)).
Remote names vary per clone, so identify them by URL. Open a PR only when the human you work for
asks, and before opening, revising or merging one by either path, use the `ngit-pr` skill.
