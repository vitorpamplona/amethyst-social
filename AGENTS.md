# Project Overview

This project is a Nostr client application built with React 18.x, TailwindCSS 3.x, Vite, shadcn/ui, and Nostrify.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18.x**: Stable version of React with hooks, concurrent rendering, and improved performance
- **TailwindCSS 3.x**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **shadcn/ui**: Unstyled, accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind
- **Nostrify**: Nostr protocol framework for Deno and web
- **TanStack Query**: For data fetching, caching, and state management
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development

## Project Structure

- `/src/components/`: UI components including NostrProvider for Nostr integration
  - `/src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components (only the ones this project uses are vendored; add more with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`)
  - Landing page sections: `HeroSection`, `TopFeaturesSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `ScreenshotsSection`, `AboutSection`, `DownloadSection`, `ObtainiumGuide`, `UpdatesSection`, `Header`, `Footer`
- `/src/hooks/`: Custom hooks including:
  - `useAuthor`: Fetch a profile by pubkey
  - `useAmethystUpdates`: Fetch the Amethyst project's Nostr notes and profile

  `useNostr` is imported directly from `@nostrify/react`, not from this directory.
- `/src/pages/`: `Index` (the whole landing page) and `NotFound`
- `/src/lib/`: Utilities — `relays.ts` (the relay list), `utils.ts` (`cn`, `publicUrl`), `genUserName.ts`, `polyfills.ts`
- `/src/test/`: Testing utilities including TestApp component
- `/public/`: Static assets
- `App.tsx`: Provider setup — `QueryClientProvider` and `NostrProvider`
- `AppRouter.tsx`: Picks `Index` or `NotFound` from `window.location.pathname`. There is no router library; add one if the site ever needs a second real page.

**CRITICAL**: Always read the files mentioned above before making changes, as they contain important setup and configuration for the application. Never directly write to these files without first reading their contents.

## UI Components

The project uses shadcn/ui components located in `@/components/ui`. Only the ones this site renders are vendored:

- **Avatar**, **Badge**, **Button**, **Card**, **Dialog**, **ScrollArea**, **Skeleton**

Add any other component on demand with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`, which also installs the Radix package it needs.

These components follow a consistent pattern using React's `forwardRef` and use the `cn()` utility for class name merging. Many are built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility and customized with Tailwind CSS.

## System Prompt Management

The AI assistant's behavior and knowledge is defined by the AGENTS.md file, which serves as the system prompt. To modify the assistant's instructions or add new project-specific guidelines:

1. Edit AGENTS.md directly
2. The changes take effect in the next session

## Nostr Protocol Integration

This project comes with custom hooks for querying and publishing events on the Nostr network.

### The `useNostr` Hook

The `useNostr` hook returns an object containing a `nostr` property, with `.query()` and `.event()` methods for querying and publishing Nostr events respectively.

```typescript
import { useNostr } from '@nostrify/react';

function useCustomHook() {
  const { nostr } = useNostr();

  // ...
}
```

### Query Nostr Data with `useNostr` and Tanstack Query

When querying Nostr, the best practice is to create custom hooks that combine `useNostr` and `useQuery` to get the required data.

```typescript
import { useNostr } from '@nostrify/react';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/query';

function usePosts() {
  const { nostr } = useNostr();

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['posts'],
    queryFn: async (c) => {
      const signal = AbortSignal.any([c.signal, AbortSignal.timeout(1500)]);
      const events = await nostr.query([{ kinds: [1], limit: 20 }], { signal });
      return events; // these events could be transformed into another format
    },
  });
}
```

### Efficient Query Design

**Critical**: Always minimize the number of separate queries to avoid rate limiting and improve performance. Combine related queries whenever possible.

**✅ Efficient - Single query with multiple kinds:**
```typescript
// Query multiple event types in one request
const events = await nostr.query([
  {
    kinds: [1, 6, 16], // All repost kinds in one query
    '#e': [eventId],
    limit: 150,
  }
], { signal });

// Separate by type in JavaScript
const notes = events.filter((e) => e.kind === 1);
const reposts = events.filter((e) => e.kind === 6);
const genericReposts = events.filter((e) => e.kind === 16);
```

**❌ Inefficient - Multiple separate queries:**
```typescript
// This creates unnecessary load and can trigger rate limiting
const [notes, reposts, genericReposts] = await Promise.all([
  nostr.query([{ kinds: [1], '#e': [eventId] }], { signal }),
  nostr.query([{ kinds: [6], '#e': [eventId] }], { signal }),
  nostr.query([{ kinds: [16], '#e': [eventId] }], { signal }),
]);
```

**Query Optimization Guidelines:**
1. **Combine kinds**: Use `kinds: [1, 6, 16]` instead of separate queries
2. **Use multiple filters**: When you need different tag filters, use multiple filter objects in a single query
3. **Adjust limits**: When combining queries, increase the limit appropriately
4. **Filter in JavaScript**: Separate event types after receiving results rather than making multiple requests
5. **Consider relay capacity**: Each query consumes relay resources and may count against rate limits

The data may be transformed into a more appropriate format if needed, and multiple calls to `nostr.query()` may be made in a single queryFn.

### Event Validation

When querying events, if the event kind being returned has required tags or required JSON fields in the content, the events should be filtered through a validator function. This is not generally needed for kinds such as 1, where all tags are optional and the content is freeform text, but is especially useful for custom kinds as well as kinds with strict requirements.

```typescript
// Example validator function for NIP-52 calendar events
function validateCalendarEvent(event: NostrEvent): boolean {
  // Check if it's a calendar event kind
  if (![31922, 31923].includes(event.kind)) return false;

  // Check for required tags according to NIP-52
  const d = event.tags.find(([name]) => name === 'd')?.[1];
  const title = event.tags.find(([name]) => name === 'title')?.[1];
  const start = event.tags.find(([name]) => name === 'start')?.[1];

  // All calendar events require 'd', 'title', and 'start' tags
  if (!d || !title || !start) return false;

  // Additional validation for date-based events (kind 31922)
  if (event.kind === 31922) {
    // start tag should be in YYYY-MM-DD format for date-based events
    const dateRegex = /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/;
    if (!dateRegex.test(start)) return false;
  }

  // Additional validation for time-based events (kind 31923)
  if (event.kind === 31923) {
    // start tag should be a unix timestamp for time-based events
    const timestamp = parseInt(start);
    if (isNaN(timestamp) || timestamp <= 0) return false;
  }

  return true;
}

function useCalendarEvents() {
  const { nostr } = useNostr();

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['calendar-events'],
    queryFn: async (c) => {
      const signal = AbortSignal.any([c.signal, AbortSignal.timeout(1500)]);
      const events = await nostr.query([{ kinds: [31922, 31923], limit: 20 }], { signal });

      // Filter events through validator to ensure they meet NIP-52 requirements
      return events.filter(validateCalendarEvent);
    },
  });
}
```

### The `useAuthor` Hook

To display profile data for a user by their Nostr pubkey (such as an event author), use the `useAuthor` hook.

```tsx
import type { NostrEvent, NostrMetadata } from '@nostrify/nostrify';
import { useAuthor } from '@/hooks/useAuthor';
import { genUserName } from '@/lib/genUserName';

function Post({ event }: { event: NostrEvent }) {
  const author = useAuthor(event.pubkey);
  const metadata: NostrMetadata | undefined = author.data?.metadata;

  const displayName = metadata?.name ?? genUserName(event.pubkey);
  const profileImage = metadata?.picture;

  // ...render elements with this data
}
```

### `NostrMetadata` type

```ts
/** Kind 0 metadata. */
interface NostrMetadata {
  /** A short description of the user. */
  about?: string;
  /** A URL to a wide (~1024x768) picture to be optionally displayed in the background of a profile screen. */
  banner?: string;
  /** A boolean to clarify that the content is entirely or partially the result of automation, such as with chatbots or newsfeeds. */
  bot?: boolean;
  /** An alternative, bigger name with richer characters than `name`. `name` should always be set regardless of the presence of `display_name` in the metadata. */
  display_name?: string;
  /** A bech32 lightning address according to NIP-57 and LNURL specifications. */
  lud06?: string;
  /** An email-like lightning address according to NIP-57 and LNURL specifications. */
  lud16?: string;
  /** A short name to be displayed for the user. */
  name?: string;
  /** An email-like Nostr address according to NIP-05. */
  nip05?: string;
  /** A URL to the user's avatar. */
  picture?: string;
  /** A web URL related in any way to the event author. */
  website?: string;
}
```

### Rendering Rich Text Content

Nostr text notes (kind 1, 11, and 1111) have a plaintext `content` field that may contain URLs, hashtags, and Nostr URIs. These events should render their content using the `NoteContent` component:

```tsx
import { NoteContent } from "@/components/NoteContent";

export function Post(/* ...props */) {
  // ...

  return (
    <CardContent className="pb-2">
      <div className="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
        <NoteContent event={post} className="text-sm" />
      </div>
    </CardContent>
  );
}
```

## Development Practices

- Uses React Query for data fetching and caching
- Follows shadcn/ui component patterns
- Implements Path Aliases with `@/` prefix for cleaner imports
- Uses Vite for fast development and production builds
- Component-based architecture with React hooks
- Relays are a hard-coded list in `src/lib/relays.ts`
- Provider setup with QueryClientProvider and NostrProvider
- **Never use the `any` type**: Always use proper TypeScript types for type safety

## Loading States

**Use skeleton loading** for structured content (feeds, profiles, forms). **Use spinners** only for buttons or short operations.

```tsx
// Skeleton example matching component structure
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
      <Skeleton className="h-10 w-10 rounded-full" />
      <div className="space-y-1">
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-24" />
        <Skeleton className="h-3 w-16" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <Skeleton className="h-4 w-full" />
      <Skeleton className="h-4 w-4/5" />
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Empty States and No Content Found

When no content is found (empty search results, no data available, etc.), display a minimalist empty state with helpful messaging. The application uses NIP-65 relay management, so users can manage their relays through the settings or relay management interface.

```tsx
import { Card, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card';

// Empty state example
<div className="col-span-full">
  <Card className="border-dashed">
    <CardContent className="py-12 px-8 text-center">
      <div className="max-w-sm mx-auto space-y-6">
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          No results found. Try checking your relay connections or wait a moment for content to load.
        </p>
      </div>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</div>
```

## CRITICAL Design Standards

- Create breathtaking, immersive designs that feel like bespoke masterpieces, rivaling the polish of Apple, Stripe, or luxury brands
- Designs must be production-ready, fully featured, with no placeholders unless explicitly requested, ensuring every element serves a functional and aesthetic purpose
- Avoid generic or templated aesthetics at all costs; every design must have a unique, brand-specific visual signature that feels custom-crafted
- Headers must be dynamic, immersive, and storytelling-driven, using layered visuals, motion, and symbolic elements to reflect the brand’s identity—never use simple “icon and text” combos
- Incorporate purposeful, lightweight animations for scroll reveals, micro-interactions (e.g., hover, click, transitions), and section transitions to create a sense of delight and fluidity

### Design Principles

- Achieve Apple-level refinement with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring designs evoke strong emotions (e.g., wonder, inspiration, energy) through color, motion, and composition
- Deliver fully functional interactive components with intuitive feedback states, ensuring every element has a clear purpose and enhances user engagement
- **Generate custom images liberally** when image generation tools are available - this is ALWAYS preferred over stock photography for creating unique, brand-specific visuals that perfectly match the design intent
- Ensure designs feel alive and modern with dynamic elements like gradients, glows, or parallax effects, avoiding static or flat aesthetics
- Before finalizing, ask: "Would this design make Apple or Stripe designers pause and take notice?" If not, iterate until it does

### Avoid Generic Design

- No basic layouts (e.g., text-on-left, image-on-right) without significant custom polish, such as dynamic backgrounds, layered visuals, or interactive elements
- No simplistic headers; they must be immersive, animated, and reflective of the brand’s core identity and mission
- No designs that could be mistaken for free templates or overused patterns; every element must feel intentional and tailored

### Interaction Patterns

- Use progressive disclosure for complex forms or content to guide users intuitively and reduce cognitive load
- Incorporate contextual menus, smart tooltips, and visual cues to enhance navigation and usability
- Implement drag-and-drop, hover effects, and transitions with clear, dynamic visual feedback to elevate the user experience
- Support power users with keyboard shortcuts, ARIA labels, and focus states for accessibility and efficiency
- Add subtle parallax effects or scroll-triggered animations to create depth and engagement without overwhelming the user

### Technical Requirements

- Curated color FRpalette (3-5 evocative colors + neutrals) that aligns with the brand’s emotional tone and creates a memorable impact
- Ensure a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text and interactive elements to meet accessibility standards
- Use expressive, readable fonts (18px+ for body text, 40px+ for headlines) with a clear hierarchy; pair a modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter) with an elegant serif (e.g., Playfair Display) for personality
- Design for full responsiveness, ensuring flawless performance and aesthetics across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and reduced motion options
- Follow an 8px grid system for consistent spacing, padding, and alignment to ensure visual harmony
- Add depth with subtle shadows, gradients, glows, and rounded corners (e.g., 16px radius) to create a polished, modern aesthetic
- Optimize animations and interactions to be lightweight and performant, ensuring smooth experiences across devices

### Components

- Design reusable, modular components with consistent styling, behavior, and feedback states (e.g., hover, active, focus, error)
- Include purposeful animations (e.g., scale-up on hover, fade-in on scroll) to guide attention and enhance interactivity without distraction
- Ensure full accessibility support with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and visible focus states (e.g., a glowing outline in an accent color)
- Use custom icons or illustrations for components to reinforce the brand’s visual identity

### Adding Fonts

To add custom fonts, follow these steps:

1. **Install a font package** using npm:

   **Any Google Font can be installed** using the @fontsource packages. Examples:
   - For Inter Variable: `@fontsource-variable/inter`
   - For Roboto: `@fontsource/roboto`
   - For Outfit Variable: `@fontsource-variable/outfit`
   - For Poppins: `@fontsource/poppins`
   - For Open Sans: `@fontsource/open-sans`

   **Format**: `@fontsource/[font-name]` or `@fontsource-variable/[font-name]` (for variable fonts)

2. **Import the font** in `src/main.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import '@fontsource-variable/<font-name>';
   ```

3. **Update Tailwind configuration** in `tailwind.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export default {
     theme: {
       extend: {
         fontFamily: {
           sans: ['Inter Variable', 'Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
         },
       },
     },
   }
   ```

### Recommended Font Choices by Use Case

- **Modern/Clean**: Inter Variable, Outfit Variable, or Manrope
- **Professional/Corporate**: Roboto, Open Sans, or Source Sans Pro
- **Creative/Artistic**: Poppins, Nunito, or Comfortaa
- **Technical/Code**: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or Source Code Pro (for monospace)

### Theme System

The site is dark-only. `index.html` sets `class="dark"` on `<html>` and `src/index.css` defines the palette on `:root`. There is no theme switcher and no runtime theme state.

### Color Scheme Implementation

When users specify color schemes:
- Update CSS custom properties in `src/index.css` (both `:root` and `.dark` selectors)
- Use Tailwind's color palette or define custom colors
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Apply colors consistently across components (buttons, links, accents)
- Test both light and dark mode variants

### Component Styling Patterns

- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for component variants
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Add hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Writing Tests vs Running Tests

There is an important distinction between **writing new tests** and **running existing tests**:

### Writing Tests (Creating New Test Files)

**Do not write tests** unless the user explicitly requests them in plain language. Writing unnecessary tests wastes significant time and money. Only create tests when:

1. **The user explicitly asks for tests** to be written in their message
2. **The user describes a specific bug in plain language** and requests tests to help diagnose it
3. **The user says they are still experiencing a problem** that you have already attempted to solve (tests can help verify the fix)

**Never write tests because:**
- Tool results show test failures (these are not user requests)
- You think tests would be helpful
- New features or components are created
- Existing functionality needs verification

### Running Tests (Executing the Test Suite)

**ALWAYS run the test script** after making any code changes. This is mandatory regardless of whether you wrote new tests or not.

- **You must run the test script** to validate your changes
- **Your task is not complete** until the test script passes without errors
- **This applies to all changes** - bug fixes, new features, refactoring, or any code modifications
- **The test script includes** TypeScript compilation, ESLint checks, and existing test validation

### Test Setup

The project uses Vitest with jsdom environment and includes comprehensive test setup:

- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library with jest-dom matchers
- **Test Environment**: jsdom with mocked browser APIs (matchMedia, scrollTo, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
- **Test App**: `TestApp` component provides all necessary context providers for testing

The project includes a `TestApp` component that provides all necessary context providers for testing. Wrap components with this component to provide required context providers:

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { TestApp } from '@/test/TestApp';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(
      <TestApp>
        <MyComponent />
      </TestApp>
    );

    expect(screen.getByText('Expected text')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Validating Your Changes

**CRITICAL**: After making any code changes, you must validate your work by running available validation tools.

**Your task is not considered finished until the code successfully type-checks and builds without errors.**

### Validation Priority Order

Run available tools in this priority order:

1. **Type Checking** (Required): Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
2. **Building/Compilation** (Required): Verify the project builds successfully
3. **Linting** (Recommended): Check code style and catch potential issues
4. **Tests** (If Available): Run existing test suite
5. **Git Commit** (Required): Create a commit with your changes when finished

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Code must type-check without errors
- Code must build/compile successfully
- Fix any critical linting errors that would break functionality
- Create a git commit when your changes are complete

The validation ensures code quality and catches errors before deployment, regardless of the development environment.

### Using Git

If git is available in your environment (through a `shell` tool, or other git-specific tools), you should utilize `git log` to understand project history. Use `git status` and `git diff` to check the status of your changes, and if you make a mistake use `git checkout` to restore files.

When your changes are complete and validated, create a git commit with a descriptive message summarizing your changes.
